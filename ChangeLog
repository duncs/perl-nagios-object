0.01 - initial release
0.03 - same as 0.01, but with higher version number to trump Nagios::Config on CPAN.
0.04 - a bunch of internal updates, nothing really new on the API side yet
0.05 - Lots of stuff all over.  A bunch of bugs were fixed and I started looking at performance.
       I'm actually writing some serious apps using these modules now, so the "dogfood test" is
       really starting to kick in.
       Thanks to the following people for patches/bug reports:
           David J. Mark
           Akihiro Sagawa
           Bjornar Bjorgum Larsen
0.06 - Big reorganization of Nagios/Object.pm which should help towards making
       extending and overloading easier.
         - !!!!!!!!!! new() now require named arguments !!!!!!!!!!!!
         - added prelimary Nagios 2.0 support - this is mostly untested 
             *** please send me <tobert@gmail.com> tests ***
         - started putting in support for a "fast mode" to skip parts of
           object resolution and registration for speed
             - being an experimental feature, it currently breaks stuff when
               enabled, but shows where the real performance problems are
         - the flags for the big hash in Object.pm now use a single integer and
           bit shifting - there is a mini program in the bin directory of this
           distribution for encoding/decoding what they mean
         - also in the bin directory is a mini program for parsing configs
           for quick testing "perldoc bin/parse.pl"
0.07 - Fix fatal bugs
       added a patch from Deomid Ryabkov to fix a couple fatal bugs I missed
0.07a - Fix a couple more
       fixed a couple other bugs reported that I found in my Inbox right after
       posting 0.07 to CPAN
0.07b - fixed minor bugs reported via email or rt.cpan.org
       new() named parameter support was missing from StatusLog.pm
       config_status_demo.pl needed it's use of new() constructors updated
0.07c - added missing hostgroup_name to service dependencies
0.07d - fixed some bugs reported via email with tests and parsing

0.08 should be coming soon, since I've got a good start on the Nagios::Test:: modules I'm forcing myself to write for it.   Once those modules are functioning, I'll be able to do some real testing on the performance of various pieces and start to replace those pesky linear (or worse) searches.  
	... fill this in from CVS later

0.09 (beta) - added support for Nagios 2.x status.dat files in StatusLog.pm
	- applied patch from Székelyi Szabolcs that fixed a bunch of bugs
	- added wildcard/regular expression support

0.09 (final) - fixed remaining bug with servicegroups
	- reported by Jörg Stelzle (who helped a ton with testing this release)

0.10 - added 'allow_missing_files' option to Nagios::Config to skip files
	specified in the nagios.cfg that don't exist (fixes RT #20924)
	- requested by Andrew Ruthven
0.11 - add check_freshness/freshness_threshold to Nagios::Host
0.12 - added check_interval to Nagios::Host (pointed out by Nenad Noveljic)
0.13 - Added status() method for Nagios 2.x logs in StatusLog.pm
	* added more tests for StatusLog.pm
	* added test v2 logfile for statuslog.t
0.14 - added some missing fields
0.15 - fixed hostgroup/hostgroups methods
	* put in first attempt at actually fixing multi-fields (takes two types of
	objects to create them)
0.16 - fix tests that failed when not run inside the 't' directory
0.17 - fix up dump() and the mess I made of hostgroups (SVN commit 25)
	* thanks to Drex Evans for loaning me a config
	* 0.18 will have better code for handling hostgroups/servicegroups
	  which are currently a hack
0.18 - add tests for dump() then make them pass
    * fixed bug with template values not being returned
	   (this looks like it was broken for ages)
    * added the template() method which will return the template object
	  even if register_objects() hasn't been called yet
	* use() is now hand-coded rather than autogenerated
	* various cleanups
	* bug fixes for bugs reported by Edward Sabol and Duane Toler
0.19 - updated fix for last status in the statuslog file
	* added $VERSION to all modules
	* added tags to test and bin files
0.20 - mostly cosmetic bugfixes
0.21 - Nagios v3 support and AUTOLOAD support for unrecognized object attributes
    * internally dropped attribute indirection through subref's - it was silly and confusing and is now gone
    * v3 support, added v3 example configs to the test suite
        - support for the new timeperiod stuff is still incomplete
        - statuslog still needs work - might just switch to the AUTOLOAD model completely for that
    * unrecognized attributes are accepted by default now - see Nagios::Object::Config for how to enable strict_mode
    * support disabling strict_mode in parse.pl and test_configuration.pl
    * cleanups for switching to git for revision control
    * updated flags on the setup hash
    * deleted attribute_allows_undef() method
    * improved dump() - it takes an optional true/false argument to tell it to flatten out
      inheritance - the default is to preserve inheritance, calling $obj->dump(1) will flatten
    * light test cleaning
