0.01 - initial release
0.03 - same as 0.01, but with higher version number to trump Nagios::Config on CPAN.
0.04 - a bunch of internal updates, nothing really new on the API side yet
0.05 - Lots of stuff all over.  A bunch of bugs were fixed and I started looking at performance.
       I'm actually writing some serious apps using these modules now, so the "dogfood test" is
       really starting to kick in.
       Thanks to the following people for patches/bug reports:
           David J. Mark
           Akihiro Sagawa
           Bjornar Bjorgum Larsen
0.06 - Big reorganization of Nagios/Object.pm which should help towards making
       extending and overloading easier.
         - !!!!!!!!!! new() now require named arguments !!!!!!!!!!!!
         - added prelimary Nagios 2.0 support - this is mostly untested 
             *** please send me <tobert@gmail.com> tests ***
         - started putting in support for a "fast mode" to skip parts of
           object resolution and registration for speed
             - being an experimental feature, it currently breaks stuff when
               enabled, but shows where the real performance problems are
         - the flags for the big hash in Object.pm now use a single integer and
           bit shifting - there is a mini program in the bin directory of this
           distribution for encoding/decoding what they mean
         - also in the bin directory is a mini program for parsing configs
           for quick testing "perldoc bin/parse.pl"
0.07 - Fix fatal bugs
       added a patch from Deomid Ryabkov to fix a couple fatal bugs I missed
