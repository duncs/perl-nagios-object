SAMPLE OBJECT CONFIG FILE README
================================

This directory contains sample object definition config files.
Sample config files have a .cfg extension.  Ignore any files with
a .in extension, as they are templates used to generate the sample
config files.

Please note that you can keep all of your object definitions in a
single file if you wish.  You may also split them up into multiple
config files, as is done here.  

Read the 'Quickstart Installation Guide' in the HTML documentation
for instructions on how to install and use these sample config files.
