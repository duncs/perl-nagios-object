This is the README.  READ IT!

Nagios::Object is a group of modules for parsing a Nagios configuration and
representing it as objects in perl.  Inheriting from templates is supported,
encoraged, and kept intact within the perl representation(s).
This is still a very early release, so not all of the methods you'll need
are implemented yet.  Coming soon to a CPAN mirror near you.  Send me your
ideas and it may happen sooner.

Installation:

  If you don't have Module::Build installed, you'll have to install it before
you can use this module's installer.  That is the only dependency in this
module.  No, I won't add Make::MakeMaker support.  The easiest way to install
Module::Build is to do "perl -MCPAN -e 'install Module::Build'".
 
  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

Bug Reports:

  Send all bug reports to myself <tobeya@cpan.org>.  In any bug report,
include a short description of your problem, and a copy of the output
from "Build test."  The more diagnostic information you send, the better.

Sending me a test script/offending code will probably get your issue fixed
fastest and as a bonus, help prevent me from breaking it again in the future.

ChangeLog:

0.01 - initial release
0.03 - same as 0.01, but with higher version number to trump Nagios::Config on CPAN.
0.04 - a bunch of internal updates, nothing really new on the API side yet
