This is the README.  READ IT!

Nagios::Object is a group of modules for parsing a Nagios configuration and
representing it as objects in perl.  Inheriting from templates is supported,
encoraged, and kept intact within the perl representation(s).
This is still a very early release, so not all of the methods you'll need
are implemented yet.  Coming soon to a CPAN mirror near you.  Send me your
ideas and it may happen sooner.

Installation:

  If you don't have Module::Build installed, you'll have to install it before
you can use this module's installer.  That is the only dependency in this
module.  No, I won't add Make::MakeMaker support.  The easiest way to install
Module::Build is to do "perl -MCPAN -e 'install Module::Build'".
 
  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install
 
Bug Reports:

  Please report all bugs via the CPAN bugs RT system:
    http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Nagios-Object
  In any bug report, include a short description of your problem and a copy 
of the output from "Build test."  The more diagnostic information you send, 
the better.

  Providing a test script/offending code will probably get your issue fixed
fastest and as a bonus, help prevent me from breaking it again in the future.

Notes:

Module maintenance was taken over by <duncs@cpan.org> in January 2009.  The
source has been placed into a git repository at:
    git://github.com/duncs/perl-nagios-object.git
